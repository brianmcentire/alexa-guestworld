An Alexa Skill for getting information about which Guest Worlds are live and coming up in Zwift

Zwift is a massively multiplayer online cycling and running platform that brings athletes from all over the world together in virtual worlds to race, train, and ride together. The platform offers a rotating selection of guest worlds each day, and this Alexa Skill lets you check the schedule hands-free while you're getting ready to ride.

It's my preferred way to inquire about my upcoming ride options while having morning coffee.

This skill is invoked with "Alexa, ask Which World..."

  * "Where can I ride today?"
  * "Where can I ride tomorrow?"
  *    ... "And after that?"
  * "When can I ride in London?"
  * "Where can I ride next Saturday?"
  * "What map is available on the 17th?"
  * "What is the route of the week?"
  * "What is the climb of the week next week?"
  * "How much XP is the route of the week worth?"
  * "When does the world change next?"

Users from all over the world, including every continent except Antarctica, have used it and I hope you enjoy it too! (If you use it from Antarctica, please let me know ;-)
